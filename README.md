# ImageM

ImageM aims to provide ImageJ-like experience in MATLAB. 

This is the starting point of a long-term project. Currently, its only working function is drag-and-drop display of image files. 

Users can drag image file from a file folder and drop it over the text area of the GUI program. If the file is an image file supported by MATLAB, it'll be displayed in a new figure.
